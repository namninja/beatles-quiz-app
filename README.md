Quiz project from Thinkful Bootcamp :  The Ultimate Beatles Quiz</br>
Project Requirements</br>
</br>
User experience requirements</br>
The following requirements cover what the app must do, from the user's perspective.</br>
</br>
*The starting screen should have a button that users can click to start the quiz.</br>
*Users should be prompted through a series of at least 5 multiple choice questions that they can answer.</br>
*Users should be asked questions 1 after the other.</br>
*Users should only be prompted with 1 question at a time.</br>
*Users should not be able to skip questions.</br>
*Users should also be able to see which question they're on (for instance, "7 out of 10") and their current score ("5 correct, 2 incorrect").</br>
</br>
Upon submitting an answer, users should:</br>
</br>
*receive textual feedback about their answer. If they were incorrect, they should be told the correct answer.</br>
*be moved onto the next question (or interact with an element to move on).</br>
*Users should be shown their overall score at the end of the quiz. In other words, how many questions they got right out of the total questions asked.</br>
*Users should be able to start a new quiz.</br>
</br>
Technical requirements</br>
Your quiz app must:</br>
</br>
*Render answer choices in a form.</br>
*Use semantic HTML, along with CSS and jQuery.</br>
*Follow a11y best practices.</br>
*Use responsive design and be usable in 320px-wide viewports.</br>
*Refer to this checklist for help.</br>
*Be fully usable by keyboard (which will be easy enough if you start with a form).</br>
</br>
Process requirements</br>
</br>
Before you dive into the app, you'll need to:</br>
</br>
*gather content for your app. That means typing up the questions you'll ask and gathering any images or icons you'll need.</br>
*think about the user experiences outlined above and how your design must make them possible.</br>
*design your app using HTML wireframes, which are HTML- (and minimal CSS-) only versions of the different screens in your app. </br>
